# my-first-lisp

Everyone has to implement a Lisp at least once, right?

This project is based on the excellent pedagogical essays of
[Stepan Parunashvili](https://stopa.io/post/222) and
[Peter Norvig](https://norvig.com/lispy.html), in Rust and Python respectively.

In contrast to the above, I'm using the LR(1) parser generator framework,
LALRPOP, as I'm too lazy to write a parser myself (_despite_ it being really
easy for S-expressions.)
